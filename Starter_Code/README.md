# webscraping-challenge

In this project, I am excited to tackle a comprehensive web-scraping and data analysis project. Throughout my learning journey, I have acquired the skills to identify HTML elements, such as their id and class attributes, and utilize this knowledge to extract valuable information using automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I have also gained proficiency in scraping various types of data, including HTML tables and recurring elements like multiple news articles on a webpage.

This challenge has two parts as follows:  

Deliverable 1: I will scrape the titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: I will scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which is presented in a table format and create a csv file.

By doing so, I will further enhance my core skills of data collection, organization, storage, analysis, and visual communication.
